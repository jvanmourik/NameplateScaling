# Classic Nameplates

Classic Nameplates is a lightweight addon for World of Warcraft: **Project Epoch** (3.3.5) that enhances the default Blizzard nameplates to more closely match the style and behavior from the Classic client. Features include UI scaling support, depth-based sorting, bar backgrounds, and introduces a few carefully chosen CVar tweaks to improve readability and visual polish.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jvanmourik/NameplateScaling/releases).
2. Extract the `.zip` file.
3. Move the NameplateScaling folder into your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` directory.
   - Example: `epoch_live/Interface/AddOns/NameplateScaling`
4. Restart WoW.

You should now see the changes applied to your default nameplates.

## Features

### Scaled nameplates
By default, Blizzard nameplates don’t follow your UI scale. This addon fixes that.

### Nameplate sorting
Sorts nameplates by distance to improve visibility when multiple units overlap

### Bar backgrounds
Adds a subtle background to both the health and cast bars for better contrast, just like in WoW Classic.

### Improved CVar settings

This addon automatically applies the following tweaks for a smoother nameplate experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CVars are client options and thus will remain after uninstalling the addon. You can revert these options back to default by running the first `/console` command listed in every section below.

#### Raised nameplates

Keeps nameplates slightly higher above mobs and players, reducing overlap.

`/console nameplateZ 0` → `/console nameplateZ 1`

</p>

#### Fade behind terrain

Nameplates no longer remain fully visible when the entity is behind terrain.

`/console nameplateIntersectOpacity 1` → `/console nameplateIntersectOpacity 0.1`

</p>

#### Camera-Based Intersection

Ensures the nameplate intersection is calculated from the camera to the entity instead of from the player, making occlusion more accurate.

`/console nameplateIntersectUseCamera 0` → `/console nameplateIntersectUseCamera 1`
